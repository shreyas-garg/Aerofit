#**Aerofit**

Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range
including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness
accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.
Business Problem
The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target
audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better
recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate
whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.
1. Perform descriptive analytics to create a customer profile for each AeroFit treadmill
product by developing appropriate tables and charts.
2. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct two-way contingency tables and compute
all conditional and marginal probabilities along with their insights/impact on the
business.
Dataset
The company collected the data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from the AeroFit
stores during the prior three months. The dataset has the following features:
